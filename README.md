# Route Management Tool

Welcome to the **Route Management Tool**, a web application that helps logistics managers efficiently plan, schedule, monitor, and assign delivery operations. The platform centralizes route planning, trip assignment, fleet management, fuel tracking, and order monitoring in one streamlined system.

## Features

- **Route Planning** – Create, edit, reorder, and archive routes with drag-and-drop stop ordering, suggested routes, and saved routes.
- **Trip Management** – Assign drivers and vehicles to trips, track status (Pending → Processing → Completed/Failed/Cancelled), update and archive trips.
- **Fleet Management** – Manage vehicles with make/model/type dropdowns, plates, capacities, odometer readings, registration and insurance details.
- **Fuel & Efficiency Tracking** – Record fuel logs and monitor km/L, cost per km, variance, and attention flags.
- **Order Tracking** – Track orders tied to trips with package details and delivery status.
- **Assignment Views** – Calendar, table, and driver views for managing trip assignments.
- **Dashboard** – Statistics and charts (Recharts) over a selectable date range, with PDF export.
