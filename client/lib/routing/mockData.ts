/**
 * Mocked historical route-performance data. There is no backend yet, so these
 * records stand in for "how this kind of route has done before". Route
 * suggestions are matched against these to show supporting historical insight.
 *
 * Two flavours of record:
 *  - With `stopIds`: describes a specific, previously-run stop combination
 *    (matched regardless of order). These take priority.
 *  - Without `stopIds`: a generic record for a vehicle + optimization "kind",
 *    so any new suggestion still gets relevant context.
 *
 * Dates/periods are anchored around late June 2026 (the app's mock "today").
